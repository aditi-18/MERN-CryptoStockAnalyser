Chapter 2 
This chapter involves mainly getting familiar with NODE,NPM and babel, thier installations and running basic hello world program. Fundamentals of HTML are needed for this, First the author starts with serverless hello world using React, the author wrongly mentions contents instead of content in the index.html file. Then the installations for Express server is done. The server is run and the index.html file is run on server on port 3000. Later on the script files are separated and the JSX transformation is done, also the support for older browsers is taken care of.
Two terminals should be used for automation, the screenshots for all the output done in this CH-2 are included in readme and also uploaded in a folder Screenshots.
